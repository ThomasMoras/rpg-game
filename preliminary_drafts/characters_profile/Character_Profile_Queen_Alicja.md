## VI. Character History

Alicja was born into a commoner family and spent her childhood in the city slums, where growing up surrounded by poverty and injustice gave her a strong desire to help others from a very young age.  
As a teenager, she began teaching younger children how to read and shared what little knowledge she could gather from rare and borrowed books, becoming deeply respected among both children and adults of the slums.  

One day, during the prince’s return from an expedition, he found her asleep beneath a tree on the outskirts of the kingdom with a fairy-tale book resting in her hands; concerned for her safety, he approached her and fell in love the moment she smiled at him.  
The prince courted her persistently and, over time, affection grew into love; after the death of the previous king and his ascension to the throne, he proposed to her and she became queen.  

Despite entering royalty, Alicja never abandoned her principles: she rebuilt the slums, established schools, improved living conditions for commoners, and actively fought corruption and abuse of power, with the king trusting her completely and implementing her reforms.  
Under her influence, the kingdom experienced a Golden Era of peace and progress.  

Her death at age 28 marked a devastating turning point; the entire nation entered mourning, the king lost part of himself, and without her moral guidance, the kingdom slowly shifted toward a more repressive direction.  
Her legacy remains — not in monuments, but in the memory of a time when hope ruled the throne.
