## VII. Character History

The Protagonist was raised by his grandfather after his mother died giving birth to him; his father was never known.  
His mother returned to her homeland already pregnant, refusing to explain the identity of the father before her death.  

His grandfather maintained a friendship with the headmaster of a local dojo, and through this connection, the Protagonist trained in swordsmanship from a young age alongside the headmaster’s daughter (Girl1).  
She became the most important person in his early life; they trained together, grew together, and forged a silent bond.  
Though he never confessed his feelings, he chose to follow her path and enrolled in the military academy to remain by her side.  

His desire to protect others and his refusal to abandon anyone stem from the trauma of losing his mother and the unresolved mystery of his lineage.  
He seeks strength not for glory, but to ensure no one else suffers alone.
