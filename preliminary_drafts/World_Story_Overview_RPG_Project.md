# []{#anchor}World & Story Report -- RPG Project

This document presents a complete overview of the narrative foundation
of the RPG project. It is intended for collaborators who are discovering
the universe, themes, and main storyline for the first time.

## []{#anchor}1. The Forgotten Legend -- The Old Era

Long before the present age, the continent was home to three advanced
civilisations. Though their names have been lost to time, their legacy
shaped the world that followed. What is now considered a fairy tale was
once reality.

### []{#anchor}1.1 The Three Civilisations

#### []{#anchor}The Sea Civilisation

The Sea Civilisation was composed of the peoples of water and ice.
Blessed by the **Ocean King**, they possessed unparalleled knowledge of
medicine and healing arts. Their scholars could cure diseases thought
impossible to treat, and their society was built around preserving life
and balance with nature. As long as the Ocean King lived, illness never
spread far.

#### []{#anchor}The Ground Civilisation

The Ground Civilisation was formed by the peoples of fire and rock,
ruled by the **Earth King**. They were masters of metallurgy, forging
powerful weapons and nearly indestructible shields. Their cities were
fortified and their armies unmatched in raw strength. Despite their
power, they never sought conquest, acting instead as protectors of the
continent.

#### []{#anchor}The Cloud Civilisation

The Cloud Civilisation, made up of the peoples of wind and thunder, was
blessed by the **Sky King**. Through science and technology, they sought
to understand the laws of the world and the universe beyond it. Their
cities floated among the clouds, powered by lightning and advanced
machinery. They represented progress, curiosity, and innovation.

### []{#anchor}1.2 The Emperor of Light and the Temple

Although different in culture and power, the three civilisations lived
in peace. This harmony was maintained by a sacred tradition: every year,
the three kings traveled to the **Temple of Light**, located at the
heart of the continent.

There, they presented offerings to the **Emperor of Light**, an ancient
guardian whose role was to preserve balance between peoples and prevent
conflict. As long as this ritual was respected, war never erupted
between the civilisations.

### []{#anchor}1.3 The Disappearance and the Collapse

One year, the three kings departed for the Temple of Light and never
returned.

No battle was recorded. No bodies were found. The Temple was later
discovered abandoned and silent.

Soon after, the world began to fall apart: - Without the Ocean King, a
devastating epidemic spread through the Sea Civilisation, wiping out
much of its population. - Without the Earth King, the Ground
Civilisation collapsed into a brutal civil war as factions fought for
control of its unmatched weaponry. - Without the Sky King, the Cloud
Civilisation abandoned its research and disappeared entirely, leaving
behind only ruined floating structures.

The continent was divided, trust vanished, and fear grew in human
hearts. This period marked the end of the Old Era.

### []{#anchor}1.4 The Holy Light

In the aftermath, elders spoke of a final safeguard: the **Holy Light**,
a power said to be capable of purging disasters and allowing humanity to
begin again. Over generations, this tale faded into myth. With no proof
and no surviving ruins accessible to the public, the Holy Light became
little more than a children's story.

## []{#anchor}2. The New Era -- The Present World

Centuries later, the world has been rebuilt. Nations have risen upon the
lands of the old civilisations, but knowledge of the past is fragmented
and distorted.

Most people believe the ancient legends are symbolic at best and
fictional at worst. Ruins from the Old Era are rare, sealed, or
undiscovered, reinforcing the idea that the stories were never real.

### []{#anchor}2.1 The Dominant Kingdom

The most powerful nation of the continent is a highly developed military
kingdom established on the former lands of the Ground Civilisation.
Using ancient war artefacts and remnants of old technology, it dominates
the region.

From the outside, the kingdom appears ideal:

-   Advanced cities and infrastructure
-   A disciplined army that claims to protect citizens
-   Constant messaging promoting unity, safety, and prosperity

However, beneath this image lies a deeply unequal system:

-   Border villages are heavily taxed and poorly defended
-   Resources are extracted and sent to the capital
-   Dissent is labeled rebellion and suppressed militarily

### []{#anchor}2.2 Other Nations

Other kingdoms exist but lack the military strength to challenge the
dominant power.

One major rival nation, built on the lands of the former Sea
Civilisation, relies on ancient medical knowledge and trade. To avoid
destruction, it cooperates economically with the dominant kingdom,
despite knowing its practices are unjust.

## []{#anchor}3. The Protagonist

The hero is a teenager (approximately 16--18 years old). His mother died
giving birth to him, and he was raised by his grandfather, his last
remaining family.

His grandfather often told him the legend of the Three Kings and the
Holy Light. Though society dismissed these stories, they formed the
emotional foundation of the hero's childhood.

After his grandfather's death, the hero enrolls in a prestigious
academic military school.

### []{#anchor}3.1 Skills and Personality

-   Average physical and magical strength
-   Basic proficiency in all elemental magics (low-level mastery)
-   Exceptional strategic intelligence and adaptability
-   Wins battles through planning, observation, and traps rather than
    brute force

Unbeknownst to him, the hero carries both **Light and Darkness** within
himself not as good and evil, but as two necessary forces of balance.

## []{#anchor}4. The Military Academy and Final Examination

The academy trains future soldiers, mages, and officers of the kingdom.

Before the final exam, the hero trains with a close friend: a powerful
but overconfident fighter whom the hero often defeats through superior
strategy.

The final examination consists of a duel against another student before
a jury of officers.

-   The opponent is exceptionally talented and skilled, surpassing the
    hero in raw ability.
-   The duel is long and intense.
-   Despite clever tactics, the hero ultimately loses.

However, the jury recognizes his strategic thinking and decision-making.
Both students pass, and the hero is specifically noted for leadership
potential rather than combat power.

## []{#anchor-1}5. First Mission -- The Breaking Point

The hero is appointed leader of a three-person squad:

-   His overconfident fighter friend
-   His former exam rival
-   A close female companion

Their first mission is to reclaim a border village allegedly invaded by
rebels from another nation. Official reports state that all civilians
have fled, authorizing unrestricted military force.

The mission proceeds smoothly at first. Enemy forces appear weak and
poorly organized.

During the operation, the hero pursues a fleeing enemy into a house,
where he discovers a woman and children. Believing them to be hostages,
he prepares to attack until the man begs for his family's lives,
revealing they are civilians defending their home.

This moment triggers a severe internal conflict within the hero.
Conflicting voices, duty, fear, and truth overwhelm him. He spares the
family and collapses unconscious.

The mission is officially declared a success. The hero chooses not to
report the civilians' existence.

## []{#anchor-1}6. Truth, Disillusionment, and Resistance

Later, the hero secretly returns to the village and learns the truth:

-   The kingdom exploits border populations
-   Protection is rarely provided
-   Heavy taxes and restrictions cause starvation
-   Military force is used to silence those who speak out

The hero shares this truth with his team. Together, they decide they can
no longer serve the kingdom.

They desert the army and seek allies beyond the kingdom's influence,
becoming fugitives.

## []{#anchor-1}7. The Central Quest -- The Artefacts of the Kings

Ancient legends speak of powerful artefacts once wielded by the Three
Kings objects capable of maintaining peace without domination.

These artefacts were never recovered after the fall of the Old Era.

The hero's ultimate objective becomes:

-   Exploring ancient ruins
-   Recovering the artefacts of the Three Kings
-   Uncovering the truth about the Old Era, the Holy Light, and his own
    hidden powers

Hunted by the army, fighting monsters, and unraveling forgotten history,
the hero's journey will determine whether balance can be restored or if
the world will repeat its past mistakes.
