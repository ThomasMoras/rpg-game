# THE OLD ERA – HISTORICAL AND COSMOLOGICAL REPORT

This document presents the consolidated historical truth of the Old Era, intended for internal narrative development and world-building reference. It details the metaphysical structure of the world, the rise of the Five Thrones, the Golden Age of Civilization, the catastrophic event known as the Holy Light, and the long-term consequences that continue to shape the current era.

## I. Cosmological Foundations

### 1. The Two Primordial Forces

Long before structured civilization, two primordial forces shaped existence: Light and Darkness. These forces are not moral opposites but existential principles competing for influence. [file:1]

Light embodies: [file:1]

- Order
- Harmony
- Structure
- Love and collective unity
- Emotional stability

Darkness embodies: [file:1]

- Chaos
- Individual will
- Anger and fear
- Corruption and emotional fracture
- Instability and transformation

The strength of each force is directly influenced by the collective emotional state of humanity. The more unified and emotionally stable the population, the stronger Light becomes. The more divided, fearful, and anger-driven the population, the stronger Darkness grows. [file:1]

### 2. The Nature of the Eternal Conflict

The conflict between Light and Darkness is not territorial but emotional. Humanity itself serves as the battlefield. Light operates openly, building institutions and inspiring visible unity. Darkness operates indirectly, influencing events through manipulation, secrecy, and emotional pressure. [file:1]

## II. The Formation of the Five Thrones

In an effort to secure dominance over the world, Light formed alliances with emerging civilizations. This marked the creation of the Five Thrones: [file:1]

- King of Sea
- King of Ground
- King of Cloud
- King of Light
- King of Darkness

Each king possessed a Royal Artefact of immense power and was supported by a loyal vassal. In the three mortal civilizations, balance was structurally embedded: if the king originated from one people, the vassal came from its counterpart. Light and Darkness, however, chose vassals exclusively from their own camps, rejecting internal contradiction. [file:1]

## III. The Royal Artefacts

Each throne possessed a Royal Artefact capable of ending all war. However, activation required the voluntary sacrifice of the reigning king. These artefacts were conceived as deterrents, symbols of ultimate responsibility rather than instruments of conquest. [file:1]

## IV. The Golden Era

For generations, Light empowered the mortal kings with healing, strength, and knowledge. Civilizations flourished. Conflict diminished. Society entered what later became known as the Golden Era. [file:1]

However, as Light increased its blessings to secure dominance over Darkness, systems became rigid. Individuality weakened. Emotional variance was increasingly viewed as instability. [file:1]

## V. The Growing Imbalance

The mortal kings began to perceive a dangerous pattern: the Light’s power that ensured prosperity was eroding human autonomy. Overdependence on divine order threatened the organic nature of humanity. [file:1]

When the kings attempted to reduce reliance on Light’s influence, Light interpreted this resistance as corruption by Darkness. Trust fractured. The alliance collapsed by the murder of the mortal kings judged guilty of high treason. [file:1]

## VI. Destabilization and Blame

With the absence of mortal kings, civilization unity became weaker and emotional unrest increased. Darkness gained strength from fear and confusion. Rather than acknowledge the consequences of excessive control, Light attributed the instability entirely to Darkness. [file:1]

## VII. The Catastrophic Decision – The Holy Light

Believing total purification to be the only solution, Light activated its Royal Artefact. To do so, the King of Light was sacrificed. [file:1]

The resulting phenomenon, known as the Holy Light, was intended to purge Darkness. However, Darkness had been defined broadly, encompassing anger, dissent, fear, and instability. [file:1]

The purge devastated the world. Most of the population perished. The King of Darkness was defeated. Civilization collapsed. Advanced systems vanished. Light itself was weakened by the loss of its king. [file:1]

## VIII. Long-Term Consequences and the Emergence of a New King

Both Light and Darkness depend on the existence of a reigning king to stabilize and channel their power. After the Holy Light, neither force retained a functioning sovereign. For many years, the world remained in a diminished and unstable state. [file:1]

Eventually, a new king was born. However, this emergence presented an unprecedented anomaly. Unlike all previous rulers, this king carried within himself both primordial essences, Light and Darkness. [file:1]

Unaware of his true nature, the new king grew without understanding his role in the cosmic structure. Light refused to fully recognize him as legitimate, judging him imperfect and unstable due to the presence of Darkness within him. Rather than accept him as sovereign, certain factions within Light considered using him as a catalyst to reactivate the Royal Artefact and restore absolute order. [file:1]

Darkness, by contrast, perceived in him a historic opportunity. If guided toward emotional fracture and dominance of his darker half, he could become the instrument through which Darkness would finally surpass Light. Without a pure King of Light, the balance of power would shift irreversibly. [file:1]

The existence of this dual-natured king represents a structural break from the past. For the first time, balance does not lie between opposing thrones, but within a single individual. His central dilemma is not choosing domination, but preventing either force from achieving absolute control. [file:1]

## Conclusion

The catastrophe of the Old Era was not the result of inherent evil, but of ideological extremism. Light pursued perfection. Darkness pursued resurgence. The mortal kings attempted preservation. In the absence of balance, the world collapsed. [file:1]

The emergence of a king embodying both forces introduces the possibility of a new equilibrium, one not founded on dominance, but on controlled coexistence. Whether this balance can be maintained remains the defining question of the current age. [file:1]
